## Hi, I’m Sean

I build safety and governance systems for AI agents, the layer between what an agent proposes and what it's allowed to do.

My path here is unusual.  I spent nearly a decade at U.S. Strategic Command as a Nuclear Strike Advisor to the President.  The authority control systems I operated, Permissive Action Links, didn't evaluate whether an action was wise.  They verified whether it was authorized.  That principle applies directly to AI agent safety.

## Current Projects

**Agent Gate**
Open-source execution authority layer for AI agents.  Intercepts tool calls, classifies actions against declarative policy, enforces vault-backed rollback before destructive operations.  The agent runs at full autonomy; the gate silently ensures every destructive action is reversible.  Live integration with Anthropic's Claude Code. Apache 2.0.

**SPACES Platform**
Scalable Parallel Agent Coordination and Execution System.  Multi-role agent hierarchy with inbox-based communication, dedicated audit agents for specification compliance, and a Context Lifecycle Management system enabling agents to survive context exhaustion through structured memory handoff.

## Background

Eight years as Senior Product Manager at the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency, where I scaled eApp from prototype to a national platform supporting 2M+ applications annually, and launched WatchTower, which eliminated a 4-year backlog and saved $16M+.  Currently Product Owner at North Dakota IT.
