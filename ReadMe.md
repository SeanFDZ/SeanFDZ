## Hi, I’m Sean

I build and operate production systems that have to keep working.

Most of my work lives behind real constraints: security, compliance, scale, and uptime.  
That means fewer demos and one-off experiments, and more long-running platforms where **reliability, data integrity, and outcomes** matter.

This GitHub reflects systems that ingest, process, and publish real-world data continuously, often through automated pipelines, rather than prototype-driven or showcase projects.

## What I work on

**Production systems**
- Long-running data ingestion and publishing pipelines  
- Systems designed for continuity, monitoring, and recovery  
- Environments where failure has consequences  

**Operational data platforms**
- Real-time and near-real-time data feeds  
- Dashboards and analytics that support decisions, not just visualization  
- Emphasis on accuracy, provenance, and repeatability  

**System reliability & outcomes**
- Stabilizing platforms rather than cycling features  
- Eliminating backlogs through data and workflow design  
- Reducing risk, operational burden, and failure modes

## About this GitHub

You’ll see a high volume of contributions here. Many are generated by scheduled production processes supporting continuous environmental and observatory data feeds.

That activity reflects **systems running every day**, not green-square optimization.

## About Me

**Technical Product & Data Leader with DoD/Federal experience.**

I’ve led and supported secure, mission-critical platforms in government and defense environments, including large-scale SaaS systems supporting millions of users.

My focus is translating complex operational needs into durable systems that perform under pressure, and continue performing after launch.

If you’re interested in building or operating systems where reliability and outcomes matter more than novelty, we’ll probably get along.

Selected case studies and system write-ups are available at https://www.fallingdata.zone
